## PaperScout: An Autonomous Agent for Academic Paper Search with Process-Aware Sequence-Level Policy Optimization

**PaperScout** is an autonomous agent for academic paper search. At each step, the agent explicitly decides *whether* and *how* to perform search or reference expansion based on the papers accumulated so far, enabling adaptive and context-aware paper exploration.

To train PaperScout effectively, we propose **Process-Aware Sequence-Level Policy Optimization (PSPO)**, a reinforcement learning method tailored for agentic, turn-based interactions. PSPO directly optimizes complete decision sequences, aligning policy optimization with interaction-level outcomes and mitigating the granularity mismatch of token-level RL in multi-step retrieval.
